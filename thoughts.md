## Thoughts

Short reflections on higher education, leadership, and public policy (occasional posts). Keep posts concise (400–800 words) with clear takeaways.

*Example topics:*  
- The stewardship mindset in academic leadership  
- Designing institutions for student readiness  
- What “access at scale” really requires
