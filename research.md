- Pioneered remote and digital intervention models adopted at scale.  
- Mentor to dozens of trainees across medicine, public health, and social science.

### Selected Publications
- Add a curated list of 8–12 publications demonstrating leadership, impact, and range. Include links to PubMed/DOIs.

### Grants & Funding

### Translation & Ventures
- Brief descriptions of startups/partnerships translating evidence into practice.
